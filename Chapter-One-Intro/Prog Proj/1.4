Imagine that you and a number of friends go to a luxury restaurant, and when you ask for the bill you want to split the amount and the tip (15 percent) between all. Write pseudocode for calculating the amount of money that everyone has to pay. Your program should print the amount of the bill, the tip, the total cost, and the amount each person has to pay. It should also print how much of what each person pays is for the bill and for the tip.

--------------------------
public class Share {
	*/ This program assumes that the tip is split evenly. amongst the people, an array of strings. */
	print bill, tip, total
	int priceB = bill / people.length
	int priceT = tip / people.length

	for int i = 0; i < people.length; i ++{
		print people[i] + "bill paid :" + price B + "tip paid" + price T
	}

}
